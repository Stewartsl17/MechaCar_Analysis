## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Below is the regression calculations for predicting variance to MPG:

Based on this, we can see that vehicle_weight, spoiler_angle, and AWD have no impact on the mpg of the vehicle. Conversely, there is an impact on the mpg of a vehicle from the vehicle_length and ground_clearance. Moreover, the p-value of this regression is 5.35e-11, which is smaller than the assumed significance level that we're using. This means that we can reject the null hypothesis and we that the data is statistically significant. Because of the proximity to 1 of the multiple R-squared (.71) and adjusted R-squared (.68), we can say that this linear model predicts mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. 

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

Write a short summary using screenshots from your total_summary and lot_summary dataframes, and address the following question:

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils

Briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

2. Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.

3. In your description, address the following questions:
   What metric or metrics are you going to test? 
   What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
   What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
   What data is needed to run the statistical test?
